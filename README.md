### Projects
Here's a list and detailed description of projects featured on My website:

- `WebView APK's`A range of Android based apps in the form of WebView's. These are just APK files that display a website. This decreases storage and resource usage but has a con. As the website is being displayed instead of the actual app, the dimensions and styling may be slightly off!
